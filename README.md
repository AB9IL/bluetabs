# Bluetabs
A simple Bash and fuzzy finder script which enables watching several mocroblog topics at once.


#### With Bluetabs you may save several batches of feeds to watch:
1. You must have Rofi or fzf for the menu.
2. Clone this project and move it anywhere convenient to you.
3. Edit the bluetabs script to correctly set the path to tw_alltopics (the file containing topics and microblog feeds).
4. Edit the BROWSER variable to contain the command for opening your web browser.
5. Edit the file tw_alltopics to set your topic descriptions and associated batches of Twitter feeds.
6. On the command line, execute the script "bluetabs"
7. To use Rofi instead of fzf, use the command "bluetabs gui"
8. When the menu appears, select the topic or manually enter a user defined list of handles.
9. Wait for the browser to appear.
11. You will see a series of tabs opening, containing the feeds.
